I observe that we have a lot of third-party which allow creating Intro/Walkthrough/SlidingBanner. But actually, these tasks can be done without using any library. Just some customized views and applied OOP can create for you reusable and flexible Intro/Walkthrough/SlidingBanner.

This repo merely demonstrates how to implement that idea. Using OOP, you can create sliding banner with dataset come from backend API and easily to update your Intro/Walkthrough if you want.
